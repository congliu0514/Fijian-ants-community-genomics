### Fijian-ants-community-genomics

* Project title: Genomic signatures indicate massive decline of endemic island insects
* Authors: Liu et al.
* Date: July-16-2024
* Project summary: In this project, we take a “community genomics” approach using high-throughput sequencing of contemporary biodiversity collections to estimate both community assembly and recent demographic trends of ants in the Pacific island.
* Codes for conducting all the analyses in the MS are located in the following respective folders: 1_phylogenomics, 2_population_genomics, 3_demographic_modeling
Main figures and statistical analysis are found in 4_statistical_analysis, and 5_R_codes
